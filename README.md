## About
Hi there, I am Atanas Vihrogonov, a self-taught Front-End Developer based in the United Kingdom. 
My journey began about a year ago, drawing inspiration from my wife, who was already starting her first job as a software engineer at the time.
I starting to implement web designs through coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and for the time being, I found that life-long learning is a fascinating process.
